Obesity-Prediction

Problem Definition

Obesity is a growing problem worldwide with the potential of an increased risk of cardiovascular dis-
eases and cancers, (De-La-Hoz-Correa et al., 2019; WHO, 2021). The WHO (2021) defines overweight
and obesity as medical problems of ‘abnormal or excessive fat accumulation.’ As of May 2023, 63.8%
and 25.9% of adults in England were reported to be overweight or obese, (Timpson, 2023). Although
preventable, the prediction of obesity is complex as there are several possible contributing factors.
This includes biological, physical, and environmental factors, (Wright and Aronne, 2012).

While data mining does not always identify causal relationships, it allows relationships to be identified
between features (Seifert, 2004). This is particularly useful for the complex prediction of obesity to
identify relationships between its possible contributing factors.

This project focuses on addressing the knowledge discovery problem of identifying the primary factors
influencing an individual’s classification as obese or overweight. The objective is to employ data min-
ing techniques, analysing a spectrum of factors encompassing both physical and lifestyle factors. By
classifying individuals’ obesity levels through data mining, the aim is to pinpoint and understand the
key contributors to obesity.
